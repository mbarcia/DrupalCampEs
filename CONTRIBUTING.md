## Working with the Drupal profile

We are using a COD profile with some changes. To make it easier for deploys and developers, we are putting all the contrib modules directly in the profile/modules/contrib folder and not using make files. This also helps to keep the COD profile with the less changes possible.

All the custom dependencies are being handled in a custom module called aedcamp that can be found on profile/modules/custom.

### Installing the site

Install the COD profile through the web interface or with Drush:

    drush si --db-url=mysql://user:pass@localhost/db cod

Then, enable the custom dependencies:

    drush en aedcamp -y

Please note there is an old DrupalCamp profile that is not being used.

### Location of custom code

You can find the custom theme on profile/themes/drupalcamp

You should put all the required contrib modules into profile/modules/contrib

All the custom code goes into profile/modules/custom

### Installing a new dependency

1. First, add it as a hook_update_X into aedcamp.install, so the people who already has installed the profile doesnâ€™t need to reinstall.

2. Second, add it to the aedcamp.info as a dependency.

Note: We are not using the cod.info file, as we have experienced some issues when adding dependencies there. (See this issue) [https://github.com/AsociacionDrupalES/DrupalCampEs/issues/18].
